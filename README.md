# nuttercode-prtg

This repository contains some scripts which return xml data for [advanced custom sensors](https://www.paessler.com/manuals/prtg/exe_script_advanced_sensor) as an [exe/xml sensor](https://www.paessler.com/manuals/prtg/custom_sensors#exe_script) for [prtg monitoring](https://www.de.paessler.com/prtg).

All scripts are dependend on [those PRTG and SNMP powershell modules](https://github.com/johanneslatzel/powershellmodules). Additional dependencies are documented in the dependend scripts. A full documentation will be added in the future.
